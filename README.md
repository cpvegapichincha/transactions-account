Modify class to inject dependencies via constructor (controller)
how do you inject this service without injecting it directly?? Implement it (decouple) (controller)
use single responsibility principle (mappers in different layer) return account with its transactions and handle with API standards when account not found (404 not found)
Create method to add new transaction (controller)
Create method to get transactions of an account, ordered by creation date descending and grouped by type (controller)
Create method to get transactions of an account filtered by min and max (controller)
Are newTransactionDto validated before entering controller? (valid annotation)
is this declared method in the correct class? explain why. (addTransaction) (service)
create a new transaction in database, return the autogenerated id of the new transaction (service)
return a list of transactions from database and consume API and return both results in a single object ordered by creation date descending and separated by type
API if service does return OK but has no information it just returns an empty list
Validate status if 0 ok if not empty list
get all transactions between amounts x and y of a given account; being x and y pathParameters of the API
filter transactions via repository not by service.
should amounts type be changed? explain why
some exceptions handled through try and catch
some exceptions handled through exceptionhandler
use "mapResponse" of "serviceMapper" in service layer
design a mapper using functions where is able to (mapResponse method)
map relation of account with transaction based on migration (Account and Transaction model)
create unit and integration tests
log different kind of levels depending of the information needed (errors, informative, and tracing)
Different httpstatus depending on method (POST: 201 CREATED, GET: 200 OK,ACCOUNT/ TRANSACTIONS NOT FOUND: 404 NOT FOUND, GENERAL ERROR: 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR)

You can add needed dependencies in pom.xml


[EXTRA POINT] use of lombok
[EXTRA POINT if min and max are sent via requestparams(queryparams) no pathVariables] 
[EXTRA POINT if TransactionController created]
[EXTRA POINT with webflux]
[EXTRA POINT] should send an async message to any queue you prefer, this queue must only log the tracing information of the account that is being searched
[EXTRA POINT] the header pass by sleuth should be present in all logs
